# Resume from Checkpoint

Continues a stopped run from its last verified checkpoint.

## Usage

```bash
runr resume <run_id>
```

## Options

- `--plan` - Show resume plan without executing
- `--force` - Resume despite environment fingerprint mismatch
- `--auto-stash` - Automatically stash uncommitted changes

## When to use

- Verification failed and you fixed the issue
- Run hit time budget
- Run stopped due to scope violation
- Worker timed out or stalled

## Preview before resuming

```bash
# See what will happen without executing
runr resume <run_id> --plan
```

## Auto-resume mode

For transient failures (timeouts, stalls), you can use auto-resume:

```bash
runr watch <run_id> --auto-resume --max-attempts 3
```

This will automatically resume when the run stops, up to 3 times.
