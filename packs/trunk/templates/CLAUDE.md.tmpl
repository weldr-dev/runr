# Claude Code Integration

This project uses Runr with Claude Code for agent tasks.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure Claude Code is installed and configured
2. Create tasks in `.runr/tasks/`
3. Run: `runr run --task .runr/tasks/your-task.md --worktree`

## How Runr Works with Claude

Runr orchestrates Claude through a phase-gated workflow:

1. **Plan**: Claude reads the task and plans implementation
2. **Implement**: Worker executes the plan, making changes
3. **Review**: Claude reviews changes against requirements
4. **Verify**: Runr runs verification commands
5. **Checkpoint**: If verified, create checkpoint with evidence

## Configuration

See `.runr/runr.config.json` for:

- Worker configuration (Claude/Codex)
- Phase assignments
- Verification tiers
- Scope and file patterns

## Tips for Claude

- Always verify incrementally during implementation
- If verification fails, fix issues before review
- Keep changes focused on task requirements
- Use verification results to guide decisions

## Workflow: {{pack_name}}

This project uses the **{{pack_name}}** pack:

- Integration branch: `{{integration_branch}}`
- Release branch: `{{release_branch}}`
- Requires verification: Yes
- Requires clean tree: Yes

Only verified checkpoints can be submitted to production branches.
