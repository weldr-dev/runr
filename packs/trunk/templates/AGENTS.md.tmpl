## Workflow: Trunk-Based Development

This project uses **trunk-based development**:

- All work happens on `main` branch (or short-lived feature branches)
- Runr creates verified checkpoints with full test evidence
- Changes are submitted directly to `main` after verification

**Key principle**: Main is always green. Only verified changes land.

## Verification Requirements

All checkpoints must pass verification before submit:

{{verification_commands}}

## Working with Runr

### Create a verified checkpoint

```bash
runr run --task .runr/tasks/my-task.md --worktree
```

This creates a checkpoint with full verification evidence.

### Submit verified changes to main

```bash
runr submit <checkpoint-id>
```

This applies the verified checkpoint to `main` (requires clean tree + verification evidence).

### View bundle/evidence

```bash
runr bundle <checkpoint-id>
```

Shows the complete change bundle with verification results.

## Guidelines for Agents

1. **Read first**: Always read files before modifying
2. **Verify incrementally**: Don't wait until the end to verify
3. **Keep changes focused**: Smaller checkpoints are easier to review and submit
4. **Trust verification**: If verification passes, the change is trustable
5. **Main is always deployable**: Never break main with unverified changes

## Project Structure

See the existing codebase for structure. Runr automatically detects verification commands from your project setup.
